# About

A collection of docker cointainers I use for various hobby projects, currently consists of the following:

- `ghost` -> ghost6 based blog setup
- `mastodon` -> Mastodon server for testing integration apps, exposed via Cloudflare tunnel
- `python` -> base "hello-world" docker setup with poetry for dependency resolution and VSCode debug capabilities
- `watchtower` -> automatic Docker image updates for all containers
