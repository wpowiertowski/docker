# About

A collection of docker containers I use for various hobby projects, currently consists of the following:

- `ghost` -> ghost6 based blog setup
- `eleventy` -> example Dockerized 11ty static website with Ghost-inspired CSS
- `homebridge` -> latest Homebridge container for HomeKit integration (armv8 architecture)
- `llama-vision` -> Llama 3.2 Vision model with CPU inference (Q4_K_M quantization) and Flask webhook API
- `python` -> base "hello-world" docker setup with poetry for dependency resolution and VSCode debug capabilities
- `vcmi` -> VCMI (Heroes of Might and Magic III engine) with web-based GUI via noVNC (ARM64)
- `verilator` -> minimal Verilator simulator for RTL simulation (based on OpenTitan container setup)
- `watchtower` -> automatic Docker image updates for all containers
